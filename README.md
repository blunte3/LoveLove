*An accessible journaling and reflection app for mental wellness.*  

## Vision  
LoveLove is designed to make journaling and self-reflection **easy, guided, and accessible for everyone**, with a focus on supporting people living with mental health challenges.  
The app provides **prompted journal entries, structured reflections, and tools that “do the heavy lifting”** of tracking and recognizing thought and behavior patterns.  

Our goal: to make mental wellness easier than ever before.
